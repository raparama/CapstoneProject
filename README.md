**[UBER Supply Demand – GAP](https://github.com/raparama/CapstoneProject/tree/master/01.%20UBER%20SUPPLY%20DEMAND%20GAP)**
 - The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation.
 - This data set is a masked data set similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. 
 - Solved this assignment <em> using EDA and data visualisation Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn </em>
 - The result of analysis present to the client, The problem root causes and hypotheses possible and recommend ways to improve.   </em>

**[GDP Analysis](https://github.com/raparama/CapstoneProject/tree/master/02.%20GDP%20ANALYSIS)**
 - The overall goal of this project is to help the Chief Minister (CMs) focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states.
 - The data sourced from https://data.gov.in/ an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India (Public Dataset).
   - First dataset comprises the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.
   - Second dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies
 - Solved this assignment <em> using Data Extract, Data cleaning, Data Analysis, EDA, Feature Engineering and data visualisation Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, glob. </em>
 - Analyse the GDP of the various states of India. Highlighted key insights draw from this data and suggest ways to improve

**[Risk Analysis in Banking and Financial Services](https://github.com/raparama/CapstoneProject/tree/master/03.%20RISK%20ANALYSIS%20IN%20BANKING%20AND%20FINANCIAL%20SERVICES)**
 - This case study aims to identify patterns which show if a client has difficulty paying their installments for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate. This will ensure that they do not reject the consumers capable of repaying the loan. 
 - Applying EDA module techniques and understanding risk analytics in banking and financial services and how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
 - Solved this assignment identify the <em> missing values, outliers, data imbalance, EDA results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, Data Visualisations Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, glob, datetime </em>

**[Car Price Predictions](https://github.com/raparama/CapstoneProject/tree/master/04.%20CAR%20PRICE%20PREDICTIONS)** 
 - The management will use it to understand how the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels.
 - Solved this assignment
   - Data preparation, Data Cleaning, outlier, EDA, Dummy Variables, Data Visualisations Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, glob, datetime 
   - Multiple linear regression model us used prediction of car prices.
   - Residual Analysis performed to observe the difference between observed and predicted value of depended variable. 
   - R-Squared, VIF model evaluation performed.
 - The model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

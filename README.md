 - The overall goal of this project is to help the Chief Minister (CMs) focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states.
 - The data sourced from https://data.gov.in/ an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India (Public Dataset).
   - First dataset comprises the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.
   - Second dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies
 - Solved this assignment <em> using Data Extract, Data cleaning, Data Analysis, EDA, Feature Engineering and data visualisation Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, glob. </em>

**[Risk Analysis in Banking and Financial Services](https://github.com/raparama/CapstoneProject/tree/master/03.%20RISK%20ANALYSIS%20IN%20BANKING%20AND%20FINANCIAL%20SERVICES)**
 - This case study aims to identify patterns which show if a client has difficulty paying their installments for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate. This will ensure that they do not reject the consumers capable of repaying the loan. 
 - Applying EDA module techniques and understanding risk analytics in banking and financial services and how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
 - Solved this assignment identify the <em> missing values, outliers, data imbalance, EDA results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, Data Visualisations Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, glob, datetime </em>

**[Car Price Predictions](https://github.com/raparama/CapstoneProject/tree/master/04.%20CAR%20PRICE%20PREDICTIONS)** 
 - The management will use it to understand how the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels.
 - Solved this assignment
   - Data preparation, Data Cleaning, outlier,Encoding (Binary 0/1), EDA, Dummy Variables, Data Visualisations Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, glob, datetime 
   - Multiple linear regression model used prediction of car prices.
   - Residual Analysis performed to observe the difference between observed and predicted value of depended variable. 
   - R-Squared, VIF model evaluation performed.
 - The model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

**[Lead Scoring](https://github.com/raparama/CapstoneProject/tree/master/06.%20LEAD%20SCORING)**
- X Education selects the most promising leads. The company requires building a model given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%. The customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance, and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
- Solved this assignment
  - Data Extract,  Data Cleaning and Preparation, Data Analysis, handling missing values, Encoding, Dummy Variables, outlier and scaling. 
  - EDA results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, Feature Engineering and data visualisation Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, glob.
  - Logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads 
  - Model Evaluation: confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC-ROC score
- This model predicts the 80% ballpark of the target lead conversion rate.

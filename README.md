**Stock Market Analysis:** MySQL analysis 20 Day and 50 Day moving averages of stock traders to determine whether to buy or sell a stock. Shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, it is a signal to BUY (Golden Cross) on the opposite it is a signal to SELL (Death Cross).
